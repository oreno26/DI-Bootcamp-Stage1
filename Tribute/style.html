        <h3>History</h3>
        <section>Photography is a form of visual art.
            unlike painting and sculpture the art if Photography is less expressive and more realistic.
            in Photography it is not as easy to change what the world shows you, you copy the view that your eyes see.
            Personaly i find that the challange in calling Photographyan art, the artist has less ways to express himself.
            Around 1717, Johann Heinrich Schulze captured cut-out letters on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry, but he apparently never thought of making the results durable. 
            Around 1800, Thomas Wedgwood made the first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing camera images in permanent form.
            His experiments did produce detailed photograms, but Wedgwood and his associate Humphry Davy found no way to fix these images.
           In 1826, Nicéphore Niépce first managed to fix an image that was captured with a camera, but at least eight hours or even several days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results were very crude. 
           Niépce's associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop the daguerreotype process, the first publicly announced and commercially viable photographic process. 
           The daguerreotype required only minutes of exposure in the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. 
           The details were introduced to the world in 1839, a date generally accepted as the birth year of practical photography.
           The metal-based daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper-based calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox Talbot and demonstrated in 1839 soon after news about the daguerreotype reached Talbot. 
           Subsequent innovations made photography easier and more versatile. 
           New materials reduced the required camera exposure time from minutes to seconds, and eventually to a small fraction of a second; new photographic media were more economical, sensitive or convenient. 
           Since the 1850s, the collodion process with its glass-based photographic plates combined the high quality known from the Daguerreotype with the multiple print options known from the calotype and was commonly used for decades. 
           Roll films popularized casual use by amateurs. In the mid-20th century, developments made it possible for amateurs to take pictures in natural color as well as in black-and-white.

           <h3>Types</h3>
           <section>
            There are three main types of cameras, SLR or single lens reflex, TLR twin lens reflex and Rangefinder.
            each one has its own advandtages lets start wtih SLR.
            with an SLR you the user sees what the lens sees via a mirror box that is inline with the lens.
            The mirror folds up and away when you take the photo.
            <br>
            A TLR has two similar lenses and you view throught one and the image is projected on the film with the other.

           <section>There are two form of photography film and digital, today we mostly just use film  it is more convenientto use compared to film.
            <br>
            film is seen as a more classic way to do it, it takes a bit more time, and you need to wait for your photos to be developed.
            film also  has lighter colors and amore natural feel.
            <br>
            pesonally i like them both just as much.
            <br>
            however, digital has a massive convenience to it, haveing your photos imidiatly and being able to easily edit them.
